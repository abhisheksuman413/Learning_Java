          Object Oriented Programing
          
          * Object -> Every object have properties and Behaviour
                   -> In java if we have to create object first we have to create class
                   -> JVM create object in java 

          * Class -> class is act as a blueprint for object

          * Class
                -> A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. 
                -> It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) 
                   that the objects created from the class will have. 
                -> In Java, classes contain fields (variables) and methods (functions) 
                   to define the state and behavior of the objects.
         * Key Points:
                -> Class is a blueprint, and Object is an instance of that class.
                -> Classes define the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.
                -> Objects are created from classes and store specific data in the attributes defined by the class.
